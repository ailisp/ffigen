'ffigen' is a modified version of the GCC backend, based on similar
modifications to the 'LCC' compiler described at:

<http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lth/ffigen/index.html>
 
It's a work derived from GCC, and therefore licensed under the GPL.

Versions of ffigen - based on GCC 2.95 sources - were distributed
as adjunct components of OpenMCL in 2001 and 2002.  It's become 
increasingly difficult to use those versions, since they're sensitive
to the exact format of the 2.95 C preprocessor output (and since GCC
2.95 is fading into obsolescence.)  The source distributions consisted
of a set of patches (relative to a canonical 2.95 source tree) and
a README file that explained the build process.

In the summer of 2004, Helmut Eller made available a set of patches
relative to GCC 3.4.1.  (Unlike previous versions, GCC 3.x's
preprocessor and frontend are a single program, so an ffigen program
derived from GCC 3 is likely to be a little more self-contained than
earlier versions.)

This version is based on GCC 4.0, builds on Helmut's work, and adds
some initial support for translating Objective-C class and method
information.  In addition, it provides a heavily conditionalized
Makefile which builds a binary package (.tar.gz file) on both LinuxPPC
and DarwinPPC.

In order to build the program, it's necessary to obtain canonical
versions of GCC (with ObjC support) for the target platform; the
Makefile tersely explains what's missing and suggests where to find
it.  You need to obtain the following files from gcc.gnu.org or a
mirror site and install them in this directory:

gcc-core-4.0.0.tar.bz2
gcc-objc-4.0.0.tar.bz2

Once those archives are installed, doing:

shell> make

will build the modified frontend, create an archive containing that
frontend and related support files, and create a text file explaining
how to install things.

These patches are maintained in CVS on clozure.com.  For anonymous
